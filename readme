🚀 Ghost Room
Serverless • Encrypted • Offline Mesh Messaging Suite
Ghost Room is a next-generation communication platform engineered for secure, fast, and censorship-resistant messaging.
Designed with a hybrid privacy architecture — combining cloud-grade reliability with true offline device-to-device communication — Ghost Room enables users to stay connected anytime, anywhere, with or without Internet access.
 
🛡 Private by Design • Engineered for Zero Exposure
Unlike traditional messengers that route all communication through centralized servers, Ghost Room minimizes metadata exposure by using:
•	Direct P2P Offline Mesh Mode (Bluetooth)
•	Serverless communication paths when offline
•	End-to-End encrypted chats
•	Locally stored conversation states
•	Secure call signalling using Agora RTC
•	Firebase services layered with client-side privacy controls
Ghost Room protects:
•	Who you talk to
•	When you talk
•	Where you are
•	How often you communicate
•	Your online/offline patterns
Because communication doesn't depend solely on Internet servers.
 
🔥 The Problem We Solve
Most messaging apps — even encrypted ones — still expose your:
•	Identity
•	IP address
•	Communication patterns
•	Contact graph
•	Online presence
•	Metadata trail
Ghost Room breaks this dependency by enabling true serverless offline messaging, so communication can happen even:
✔ Without SIM card
✔ Without Internet
✔ Without any central servers
✔ Without revealing metadata
 
📡 What Makes Ghost Room Different
🔗 1. Offline Mesh Mode — Device-to-Device Bluetooth Messaging
A signature Ghost Room innovation.
When there is no Internet, users can still communicate using:
Encrypted peer-to-peer Bluetooth messaging
•	One-to-one chats
•	Broadcast messaging
•	Local mesh networking
•	High-resilience device hopping
•	No servers, no SIM, no IP address
The message never touches the Internet.
Never touches a server.
Never reveals metadata.
This is true serverless communication.
 
🔒 2. End-to-End Encryption
Ghost Room uses modern encryption for:
•	Chats
•	Status updates
•	Calls
•	Offline mesh messages
Cryptographic keys are stored securely on-device, ensuring zero knowledge exposure.
 
🌐 3. Hybrid Privacy Architecture
Ghost Room blends the best of both worlds:
Online Mode (Cloud-Assisted Security)
Powered by:
•	Firebase Authentication
•	Realtime Database
•	Firestore/Storage
•	Cloud Functions
Optimized for speed, scalability, and reliability — while keeping sensitive metadata minimized.
Offline Mode (True Serverless Communication)
Powered by:
•	Peer-to-peer encrypted Bluetooth
•	Local Realm database
•	Local message queues
•	No cloud dependency
 
📞 4. Secure Calling via Agora RTC
•	1-on-1 and group calls (up to 11 participants)
•	Encrypted audio/video streams
•	Optimized for low latency
•	Works in low bandwidth environments
 
🧩 5. Modern, Scalable, Production-Ready Tech Stack
•	Kotlin + Java 17
•	Firebase / FCM / Firestore
•	Agora RTC SDK
•	Realm Database
•	Jetpack Compose / Navigation / Lifecycle
•	Retrofit + RxJava
•	WorkManager for background tasks
