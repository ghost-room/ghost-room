# Ghost Room

**Serverless • Encrypted • Offline Mesh Messaging Suite**

Ghost Room is a next-generation communication platform engineered for secure, fast, and censorship-resistant messaging. Designed with a hybrid privacy architecture — combining cloud-grade reliability with true offline device-to-device communication — Ghost Room enables users to stay connected anytime, anywhere, with or without Internet access.

## Private by Design • Engineered for Zero Exposure

Unlike traditional messengers that route all communication through centralized servers, Ghost Room minimizes metadata exposure by using:

- **Direct P2P Offline Mesh Mode (Bluetooth)**
- **Serverless communication paths when offline**
- **End-to-End encrypted chats**
- **Locally stored conversation states**
- **Firebase services layered with client-side privacy controls**

Ghost Room protects:
- Who you talk to
- When you talk
- Where you are
- How often you communicate
- Your online/offline patterns

Because communication doesn't depend solely on Internet servers.

## The Problem We Solve

Most messaging apps — even encrypted ones — still expose your:
- Identity
- IP address
- Communication patterns
- Contact graph
- Online presence
- Metadata trail

Ghost Room breaks this dependency by enabling true serverless offline messaging, so communication can happen even:
- ✔ Without SIM card
- ✔ Without Internet
- ✔ Without any central servers
- ✔ Without revealing metadata

## What Makes Ghost Room Different

### 1. Offline Mesh Mode — Device-to-Device Bluetooth Messaging

A signature Ghost Room innovation. When there is no Internet, users can still communicate using encrypted peer-to-peer Bluetooth messaging:

- One-to-one chats
- Broadcast messaging
- Local mesh networking
- High-resilience device hopping
- No servers, no SIM, no IP address

The message never touches the Internet. Never touches a server. Never reveals metadata. This is true serverless communication.

### 2. End-to-End Encryption

Ghost Room uses modern encryption for:
- Chats
- Status updates
- Calls
- Offline mesh messages

Cryptographic keys are stored securely on-device, ensuring zero knowledge exposure.

### 3. Hybrid Privacy Architecture

Ghost Room blends the best of both worlds:

#### Online Mode (Cloud-Assisted Security)
Powered by:
- Firebase Authentication
- Realtime Database
- Firestore/Storage
- Cloud Functions

Optimized for speed, scalability, and reliability — while keeping sensitive metadata minimized.

#### Offline Mode (True Serverless Communication)
Powered by:
- Peer-to-peer encrypted Bluetooth
- Local Realm database
- Local message queues
- No cloud dependency

### 4. Modern, Scalable, Production-Ready Tech Stack

- Kotlin + Java 17
- Firebase / FCM / Firestore
- Realm Database
- Jetpack Compose / Navigation / Lifecycle
- Retrofit + RxJava
- WorkManager for background tasks

│  (Activities, Fragments, Views)    │
└──────────────┬──────────────────────┘
               │
┌──────────────▼──────────────────────┐
│         ViewModel Layer             │
│  (Business Logic, State Management) │
└──────────────┬──────────────────────┘
               │
┌──────────────▼──────────────────────┐
│         Domain Layer                 │

- **Key Exchange**: Secure key exchange protocol for establishing encrypted channels
- **On-Device Key Storage**: Cryptographic keys never leave the device
- **Forward Secrecy**: Keys are rotated to prevent historical message decryption

### Privacy Protections

- **No IP Logging**: IP addresses are not stored or logged
- **Local-First**: Messages are stored locally first, synced only when necessary
- **Offline Mode**: Complete functionality without Internet connectivity
- **No Contact Sync**: Contact information stays on your device

### Data Handling
- **Local Storage**: All sensitive data stored in encrypted Realm database
- **No Cloud Backup**: Messages are not automatically backed up to cloud
- **User Control**: Users can export/delete their data at any time
- **Transparency**: Open-source code allows full security audit

### Security Best Practices
- Regular security audits
- Dependency updates for known vulnerabilities
- Secure coding practices
- No hardcoded secrets in source code
- Certificate pinning for API calls

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**1. Is Ghost Room completely free?**  
Yes. It's open-source and free for everyone.

**2. Does Ghost Room collect any personal data?**  
No. We avoid all unnecessary data collection. Only the absolute minimum required to function is used — and never stored long-term.

**3. Can I verify the security of the code myself?**  
Absolutely. The entire source code is public, reviewable, and open to audits.

**4. Is Ghost Room suitable for team or business communication?**  
Yes — it works for individuals, small teams, and anyone who values privacy over convenience.

**5. How does offline mesh mode work?**  
When devices are within Bluetooth range and have no Internet, they automatically switch to encrypted Bluetooth P2P communication. Messages are delivered directly between devices without any server involvement.

**6. Is my data safe if I lose my device?**  
Yes. All data is encrypted with keys stored on-device. Without your device and authentication, data cannot be accessed. You can also enable additional security features like biometric locks.

**7. Can I use Ghost Room internationally?**  
Yes. Ghost Room works anywhere, with or without Internet. The offline mesh mode is particularly useful in areas with poor connectivity or network restrictions.
